# NBA_Rookie_Logistic-Regression
The objective is to predict the 5-Year Career Longevity for NBA Rookies using Logistic Regression.
Models Used - Logistic regression using Gradient Descent and Maximum Likelihood Estimation and evaluated all the training and test cases based on the calculated accuracy.
Performed the Exploratory Data Analysis , PCA and Balancing using SMOT Function.
Our classes are imbalanced in our dataset, and the ratio of less than 5 years to more than 5 years instances is 37:62. I have used the SMOT(Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique, or SMOTE )for  balancing the dataset by increasing the size of rare samples Rather than getting rid of abundant samples.
